# 📚 Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Multimodal RAG** is an advanced form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation that works with **multiple data types** — not just text.  

---

## 🔍 How RAG Works (Recap)
In **standard RAG**:
1. A **retriever** searches a knowledge base for relevant chunks (usually text).
2. Those chunks are passed to an **LLM** to generate a final answer.

---

## 🖼️ What Makes It *Multimodal*?
In **multimodal RAG**, the knowledge base can store and retrieve **different modalities** of data:

- 📝 **Text** (documents, transcripts, code)  
- 🖼️ **Images** (photos, diagrams, charts)  
- 🎥 **Videos** (frames, captions, transcripts)  
- 🔊 **Audio** (speech, sound)  
- 📊 **Structured data** (tables, graphs)  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Multimodal Embedding Creation**  
   - Create embeddings for each modality:
     - **Text:** Traditional text embeddings  
     - **Images:** CLIP or similar vision-language models  
     - **Audio:** Whisper or speech-to-text models  
     - **Video:** Frame extraction + vision models  
   
2. **Retriever**  
   - Searches across multimodal embeddings:
     - Text-to-text  
     - Image-to-image  
     - Text-to-image  
     - Combined modality retrieval  

3. **Fusion**  
   - Combine retrieved items (text, captions, image features) into a single context.

4. **Generation**  
   - A **multimodal LLM** (like GPT-4o, Gemini, or LLaVA) processes the combined context to generate responses, which can include **both text and images**.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

| Use Case | How Multimodal RAG Helps |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Medical Assistant** | Doctor uploads an X-ray 🩻 and asks, “Compare this with last month’s scan and describe changes.” The system retrieves past scans (image) + reports (text) for analysis. |
| **Video Q&A** | User asks, “Show me where the person in this lecture explains the main theorem.” The retriever finds the exact video segment 🎥 using transcript + visual cues. |
| **E-commerce Search** | User uploads a shoe photo 👟 and says, “Find similar models under $100.” The system retrieves from both product descriptions (text) and product images. |
| **Legal AI Assistant** | Lawyer uploads a contract 📄 and asks, “Find case laws that match this clause.” The system retrieves relevant text + scanned documents. |

---

## 🔑 Key Difference from Regular RAG
- **Regular RAG** → retrieves only text embeddings.  
- **Multimodal RAG** → retrieves and fuses information from **multiple content types**.

---

💡 **Pro Tip:** Multimodal RAG is most powerful when paired with a multimodal LLM, allowing richer understanding and generation across text, image, audio, and video.


# 📚 Types of Embeddings in **Multimodal RAG** & Why It’s Needed

---

## 🔹 1. Types of Embeddings in **Multimodal RAG**

In **default RAG**, we usually deal with **text embeddings** — vectors representing words, sentences, or documents for semantic search.  
In **multimodal RAG**, we expand this idea to multiple modalities like images, audio, and video.

---

### 1️⃣ **Text Embeddings** 📝  
- **What they are**: Numerical representations of text capturing meaning, context, and semantics.  
- **Example models**: OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002`, Sentence-BERT.  
- **Use case in multimodal RAG**:  
  - Searching text descriptions in a mixed dataset (e.g., find images based on a caption).  
  - Retrieving related documents for answering queries.

---

### 2️⃣ **Image Embeddings** 🖼️  
- **What they are**: Vector representations of images capturing visual features (colors, shapes, objects, style).  
- **Example models**: CLIP (OpenAI), OpenCLIP, BLIP.  
- **Use case in multimodal RAG**:  
  - Query: "Show me designs similar to this sketch" → retrieve visually similar results from a vector database.  
  - Linking text queries to images via a joint text-image embedding space.

---

### 3️⃣ **Audio Embeddings** 🎧  
- **What they are**: Encoded representations of audio signals capturing tone, pitch, speech content, or musical features.  
- **Example models**: OpenAI’s Whisper (for speech → text embeddings), Wav2Vec2.  
- **Use case in multimodal RAG**:  
  - Search: “Find all customer calls mentioning product complaints in an angry tone.”  
  - Retrieve audio snippets based on textual descriptions.

---

### 4️⃣ **Video Embeddings** 🎥  
- **What they are**: Representations of both visual frames and temporal information from videos.  
- **Example models**: VideoCLIP, X-CLIP.  
- **Use case in multimodal RAG**:  
  - Search videos by text (e.g., “Find clips where a red car stops at a traffic light”).  
  - Retrieve key moments from long videos for Q&A.

---

### 5️⃣ **Cross-modal (Joint) Embeddings** 🔄  
- **What they are**: Embeddings created in a **shared latent space** for multiple modalities (e.g., text ↔ image, text ↔ audio).  
- **Example models**: CLIP creates embeddings where an image of a dog and the word “dog” are close in vector space.  
- **Use case in multimodal RAG**:  
  - Direct cross-modal search — “Find images that match this sentence” or “Find audio matching this description.”

---

## 🔹 2. Why Do We Need **Multimodal RAG** if We Already Have Default (Text-only) RAG?

**Default RAG** = 🗂️ **Text-only retrieval** → great for document Q&A, knowledge base search, and chatbots.

### ❌ Limitations of Default RAG:
- Many real-world datasets are **not just text**.  
- Product catalogs have **images + descriptions**, customer service logs have **audio + transcripts**, surveillance archives have **video + metadata**.  
- Text-only RAG ignores valuable **non-textual context**.

---

### ✅ How **Multimodal RAG** Solves This:
1. **Understands multiple formats** → Can retrieve and reason over text, images, audio, and video in one pipeline.  
2. **Cross-modal search** → A text query can retrieve an image, or an image can retrieve related text.  
3. **Better grounding** → Answers are based on richer evidence, not just written documents.  
4. **Enables new use cases**:
   - Visual Q&A (ask questions about images/videos)  
   - Audio analytics (query based on tone/sound content)  
   - Multi-format knowledge bases (combine docs, photos, audio clips)

---

### 📌 Summary Table

| Feature                  | Default RAG (Text-only) | Multimodal RAG |
|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Input Types**          | Text                   | Text, Images, Audio, Video |
| **Embeddings**           | Text embeddings only   | Multi-format & joint embeddings |
| **Search Capability**    | Text → Text            | Text ↔ Image, Text ↔ Audio, Image ↔ Image, etc. |
| **Use Cases**            | Document Q&A, chatbots | Visual search, audio analytics, multi-format QA |

---

💡 **In short**:  
- **Default RAG** = Text embeddings + text search.  
- **Multimodal RAG** = Unified embeddings across text, image, audio, video → enabling richer, more versatile retrieval and reasoning.
