# 📚 Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Multimodal RAG** is an advanced form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation that works with **multiple data types** — not just text.  

---

## 🔍 How RAG Works (Recap)
In **standard RAG**:
1. A **retriever** searches a knowledge base for relevant chunks (usually text).
2. Those chunks are passed to an **LLM** to generate a final answer.

## 🖼️ What Makes It *Multimodal*?
In **multimodal RAG**, the knowledge base can store and retrieve **different modalities** of data:

- 📝 **Text** (documents, transcripts, code)  
- 🖼️ **Images** (photos, diagrams, charts)  
- 🎥 **Videos** (frames, captions, transcripts)  
- 🔊 **Audio** (speech, sound)  
- 📊 **Structured data** (tables, graphs)  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Multimodal Embedding Creation**  
   - Create embeddings for each modality:
     - **Text:** Traditional text embeddings  
     - **Images:** CLIP or similar vision-language models  
     - **Audio:** Whisper or speech-to-text models  
     - **Video:** Frame extraction + vision models  
   
2. **Retriever**  
   - Searches across multimodal embeddings:
     - Text-to-text  
     - Image-to-image  
     - Text-to-image  
     - Combined modality retrieval  

3. **Fusion**  
   - Combine retrieved items (text, captions, image features) into a single context.

4. **Generation**  
   - A **multimodal LLM** (like GPT-4o, Gemini, or LLaVA) processes the combined context to generate responses, which can include **both text and images**.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

| Use Case | How Multimodal RAG Helps |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Medical Assistant** | Doctor uploads an X-ray 🩻 and asks, “Compare this with last month’s scan and describe changes.” The system retrieves past scans (image) + reports (text) for analysis. |
| **Video Q&A** | User asks, “Show me where the person in this lecture explains the main theorem.” The retriever finds the exact video segment 🎥 using transcript + visual cues. |
| **E-commerce Search** | User uploads a shoe photo 👟 and says, “Find similar models under $100.” The system retrieves from both product descriptions (text) and product images. |
| **Legal AI Assistant** | Lawyer uploads a contract 📄 and asks, “Find case laws that match this clause.” The system retrieves relevant text + scanned documents. |

## 🔑 Key Difference from Regular RAG
- **Regular RAG** → retrieves only text embeddings.  
- **Multimodal RAG** → retrieves and fuses information from **multiple content types**.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Multimodal RAG is most powerful when paired with a multimodal LLM, allowing richer understanding and generation across text, image, audio, and video.
